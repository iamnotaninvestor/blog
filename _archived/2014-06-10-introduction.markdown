I am a stock market novice and am starting this blog to document my progress. I hope that writing this blog will force me to be more analytical and also force me to learn from my failures and successes. I'd like to share those failures and successes with other novices in the hope that it may help. I'm new to both fundamental and technical analysis and charting in general.


###What's with the Blog's Title?  
I am not an investor. The title is a play on the fact that: 

a) At this point in time I'm just starting out and I really don't know what I'm doing. 

b) I'm speculating, not investing. 

c) I plan to daytrade and not purchase stocks for the long term.

###About Me  
I work as a software developer and have no (ZERO!) formal training or other experience investing in the stock market, nor do I have any market-insider friends. I am of reasonable intelligence, want to learn and have decided that the best way to do so is by jumping in. I have $10,000 that I'm willing to invest and can tolerate losing. 'Tolerate' being the operative... In the short-to-medium term I'd like to double that figure via my returns. In the long term I would like to day-trade full time from home. Hopefully on a lake somewhere. We'll have to wait and see if either is feasible.

###Why the Anonymity?  
It's not a huge deal, but all being equal I'd prefer to keep my finances private. Perhaps when I'm actually making some money on the market I won't care as much. We'll see.

###Why Blog?  
1. To keep myself honest. If I think deeply enough about my mistakes I won't repeat them. There are lessons to be learned both from losses and from gains. 
2. Hopefully, to earn some additional investment capital. I'll use affiliate links in the hope of generating some revenue.
3. To document the process for anyone just starting out. I am a few weeks in and I've already learned a massive amount. If I can impart any knowledge this will all be worthwhile!

###What Else do you Need to Know?  
1. I repeat, I do not know what I'm doing. Don't follow my trades blindly and certainly don't take me for a financial adviser.
2. From time to time I will recommend products/platforms/books/materials. I will only recommend products that I like. I will fully disclose any products I've been paid to use or rovided with free access to in exchange for a review. I will be objective in my reviews.

###What's Next?
This is somewhat of a fluffy introductory post. Next, I'll review some of my prior trades (over the last 3-4 weeks).
