#Thoughts on Paper Trading
The benefits of paper trading are debatable and contentious. For me, paper trading is important up to a point. At its simplest, trading can be broken into plan and execution


There are two questions you have to ask:

1. Will the market behave the same way when paper trading as it does in real life? The answer is, probably not. Your orders won't be filled, you may have more slippage or miss out on trades completely. 
2. Will *you* behave the same when trading real money versus fake money. Definitely not. 


 I personally use two tiers of paper tradings. I use Tradingsim, which I'll review later in this post, to test strategies in my downtime. Firstly 


- Beta version is *really* nice
- Felt nerves at first

#Paper Trading....Really?
Would you prefer to lose real money?
- Cheapest place to learn trade

On the other hand
- No skin in the game
- Executions may work differently in real life
- No commission/fees/etc.


#Things that I didn't like
- I wish it was setup a little more like Das Trader (montage window per chart, etc.)
- Because it's a web app you're limited to the number of trade "windows" you can have open, etc.
