- Not an alert service
- No ego allowed
-- Sometimes seems punitive
-- On the whole, it makes the room better and removes clutter

#####The Bad
- Scans. No consistent language, meaning that it is sometimes difficult for a new user to know if the play is a long or short (or either, depending on circumstance). Obviously, if you don't understand *why* you're making a certain play, you probably shouldn't be doing it. But a little context would help develop that base understanding.
