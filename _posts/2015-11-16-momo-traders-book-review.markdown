#####Introduction
I am a paying member of the Investors Underground (IU) chat room and have purchased both IU training DVDs. I'm a fan of both and will be reviewing them in subsequent blog posts. As such, I was familiar, by reputation, with a number of traders interviewed in this book prior to purchasing it. In fact, I learned about this book from a tweet by Nathan Michaud, founder of IU. While Nate's name is included in the title's byline (and he serves as an interviewee) his contribution with regard to the book's content appears limited. This is neither a good thing, nor a bad thing, just a note.

Initially, I had a couple of concerns about [Momo Traders](http://www.momotraders.com/). Firstly, I worried that it would be a fluff title, leveraging the IU subscriber base to quickly sell a book of inferior quality to the community. This turned out not to be the case, and the book stands on its own two feet as you'll soon see.

Secondly, at double the cost of many of the trading paperbacks at my local bookstore, the price ($42, including $5 shipping) felt a little high at first. Oddly, I didn't explore this misgiving until writing this blog post. My concern was founded on the shaky tenet that only a thick technical manual should cost so much and that this, as a paperback and more casual read, would not justify the price. Obviously this is nonsensical and, if you learn even one thing from this book, your outlay will be repaid many times over - there aren't many industries where an investment in skills reaps such a significant and measurable return. Add to this that a portion of the book's profits goes to charity and $40 seems eminently reasonable.


#####The Good
This book reminded me in many ways of *Founders at Work*, an extremely popular book among software startups, by Jessica Livingston. This is a very good thing. Written by Brady Dahl, *Momo Traders* is composed of the author's interviews with numerous momentum traders (and even a swing trader) who provide their insights, outline their strategies and speak about their ups and downs and their early days in the stock market. 

> "*There's nothing quite like Momo Traders on the market.*"

The first thing to note is that there's nothing quite like Momo Traders on the market. Most available titles are huge technical tomes or narrative driven tales of trading desk wizards and hedge fund managers. There isn't a whole lot out there for the little guy. Or the day trader who's been trading for a while and is struggling to make it to the next level. Given the isolated nature of day trading, it's a wonder that it took so long for a book of this nature to come to fruition. It was long overdue!

The second thing to note is that Momo Traders won't teach you how to trade. It's not a trading manual, nor is it meant to be one. It won't teach you chart patterns or fundamentals or even how to respond to price action. But it *is* still insightful, providing a wealth of feedback from knowledgeable and proven day-traders. Unlike many titles on the market, Momo Traders is immediately accessible. It's never dry and is a very enjoyable read, in equal parts insightful and motivating. The interviewer does a good job of asking the right questions and interviewees are consistently candid and often funny when describing past losses. Seeing other traders discussing their weaknesses (and not just strengths) reinforces the belief that one can have a successful career in momentum trading, despite the negative public perception traditionally associated with doing so. 

Since chapters comprise of single interviews, they lend themselves to be good stopping points, making the book easy to pick up and put down. I read it over the course of a weekend and was genuinely saddened when I reached the end. New traders will get a feel for the road ahead and a better understanding of the roadblocks their predecessors faced and some universal bad habits to avoid. Even experienced traders will be able to glean enough insight to better their own trading. Because it is a compilation of interviews the book isn't at all opinionated. It never prescribes how one should trade. Each trader interviewed has his/her own trading style and I was surprised by the diversity of strategies employed by the interviewed traders. This, to me, was the most valuable facet of *Momo Traders* as it broadened my understanding of what is possible and why people trade the way they do. My copy is striped with luminous yellow highlights and scribbled margin-notes and this is one of very few books that I own that I will take the time to read again.

#####The Bad
Momo Traders really doesn't have any major deficiencies. Forced to provide some critical feedback, I'd first point to the lack of an interview with the author. I would have liked to have an extra chapter with an interview of Brady Dahl himself to hear more about his trading background and insights into his strategies. As a former writer on *Sons of Anarchy* he has an interesting backstory and as the writer of Momo Traders he has a unique vantage point that could have been leveraged. This was an opportunity lost. 

Another *tiny* change I would make would be to modify the ordering of the chapters so that the book would have ended on a chapter about momentum trading and not on swing trading. Note: the chapter on swing trading was insighftul in its own right, and definitely deserving of a place elsewhere in the book. This is a personal preference but finishing the title with a topic that I was less interested in was somewhat anti-climactic.

#####In Closing
I thoroughly enjoyed this book and and will be looking forward to the next installment, assuming there is one. It's extremely approachable and there's a little something for everyone.
