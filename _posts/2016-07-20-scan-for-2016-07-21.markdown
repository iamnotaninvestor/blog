**Bias**: <mark class="long">Long</mark>

**Why**: This might be on scan for a few more days. I think this can still go higher. Nice move today. Annoyed I wasn't in. If it breaks 27 it could have a big green day soon. 

**Trade Plan:** 

Ideally some pullback and confirmation of 26.50, then higher lows. Otherwise confirm 27

**Levels of Interest**:

Support: 26

**Bias**: <mark class="long">Long</mark>

**Why**: Super annoyed at this. Has been on and off scan for a while. Took it off today and it jumped 6%.  There is a lot of potential upside here, with no resistance in sight.  

**Trade Plan:** 

Want to see what happens at 57. If it holds, this can make a move towards 60. If 57 fails, wait to see what happens at 56.20s support level. 

**Levels of Interest**:

Support: 57, 56.20

**Bias**: <mark class="short">Short</mark>

**Why**: OK trade on this today. Still interested in a short here. Another red day and failed SMA 50 today. 

**Trade Plan:** Either push towards 68 and fail or increased selling under SMA 50. Looking for lower highs, high volume on red candles and pullback for entry.

**Levels of Interest**:

* Resistance: 68, 67.70s (SMA 50)

**Bias**: <mark class="short">Short</mark>

**Why**: Big down day on earnings. Broke through SMAs and bottom of trend. This may drop in the morning. 

**Trade Plan:** Weak open, lower highs on set risk. If gaps down, look at 60 level to risk off of.
