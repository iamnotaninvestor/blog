**Bias**: <mark class="short">Short</mark>

**Why**: Near top of downward trend and failed to break through SMA 50. Think this has a few red days coming. 

**Trade Plan:** Ideally drop through 73 and failed retests. If it moves upwards, very interested in 74 mark as this marks the top of a downward trend that started in April; might be some resistance here.

**Levels of Interest**:

* Resistance: 74, 73

**Bias**: <mark class="long">Long</mark>

**Why**: Still think there is a lot of potential upside here, with no resistance in sight.  

**Trade Plan:** 

Needs to break and hold 56 and move higher. I don't necessarily expect this to happen tomorrow, but want it on scan for when it moves towards 60. I suspect this will have a huge breakout day soon.

**Levels of Interest**:

Resistance: 57, 56
Support: 55

**Bias**: <mark class="short">Short</mark>

**Why** Like how the chart looks. Nice downward move from 65. Broke below SMA 20 and 50. Topping candle and whole number break today. 

**Trade Plan:** Ideally tests 62 a few times and fails. Nice to have a whole number to risk off. Could have a couple of dollar downward move in it soon.

**Levels of Interest**:
Support: 62
