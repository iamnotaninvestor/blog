ME: Long Term Breakout
{% endcomment %}
**Bias**: Long

**Why**: All the same reasons as before. I had a decent trade on this ticker today but exited prematurely, minimizing profits. I still like this for a move towards 50.

**Trade Plan:** Breaks and confirms 49, shows higher lows.

**Levels of Interest**:

* Resistance: $49, $50

ME: Long Term Breakout
{% endcomment %}
**Bias**: Long

**Why**: I want to keep this on scan for potential breakout to 40. May consolidate a little before further upward movement - ~7 green days in a row, with diminishing volume.

**Trade Plan:** Needs to hold 36 and show higher lows.

**Levels of Interest**:

* Support: 35

CLVS (Previous Close: <mark>14.70</mark> | ATR: <mark>1.12</mark>)

ME: Potential Breakout
{% endcomment %}
**Bias**: Long

**Why**: Crossed SMA20 and SMA50. Can push to 17 if 15 holds.

**Trade Plan:** Weak open, hold 14 and show higher lows or strong open, re-test and confirm 15 and higher lows.

**Levels of Interest**:

* Support: 14.10, 14
* Resistance: 17.30

CCI (Previous Close: <mark>102.56</mark> | ATR: <mark>1.34</mark>)
---
{% comment %}
ME: Overbought
{% endcomment %}
**Bias**: Short

**Why**: Starting to question this plan, but will keepon radar for now in case there is a big pullback. Could be a case that the consolidation is over and this is going to head higher.

**Trade Plan:** Waiting for failed 102 or 105 push and then lower highs. Will only trade this on pullback with set risk and lower highs.

**Levels of Interest**:

* Resistance: $102, $105
