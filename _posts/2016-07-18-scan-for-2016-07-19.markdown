**Bias**: <mark class="long">Long</mark>

**Why**: Decent trade today. I think this can still go higher. If it can hold 26, this could have a big green day. 

**Trade Plan:** 

Looking for confirmation that 26 level is solid and higher lows. Risk off 26. Don't enter if this drops below 26.

**Levels of Interest**:

Support: 26

**Bias**: <mark class="long">Long</mark>

**Why**: Funny how the same tickers show up on scan over and over again...35 level is key and if this can break upwards there's not much resistance before 37

**Trade Plan:** Ideally weak open, confirmation that 35 holds and higher lows for accumulation. Keep an eye on SPY as this could potentially tank on a big red day.

**Levels of Interest**:

* Support: $35
* Resistance: $37

**Bias**: <mark class="short">Short</mark>

**Why**: Big resistance at 85. Straddling SMA 20 and 50. Green day today but finished mid range. Could be a big downward move coming.

**Trade Plan:** Ideally strong open or gap up for a failed upward move towards 85. Lower highs and set risk off 85 or prior high.

**Levels of Interest**:

* Resistance: $85

**Bias**: <mark class="short">Short</mark>

**Why**: Could easily continue higher but interested in downward trend starting in February. Could be some nice red days as this level is approached. 

**Trade Plan:** Ideally strong open, attempted push to 60, fail, lower highs. Set risk of 60 or previous highs.

**Levels of Interest**:

* Resistance: 60
