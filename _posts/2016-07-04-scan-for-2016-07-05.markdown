CCI (Previous Close: <mark>100.33</mark> | ATR: <mark>1.26</mark>)
---
{% comment %}
ME: Overbought
{% endcomment %}
**Bias**: Short

**Why**: Keeping this on scan for now. Still think it needs to pull back before going *too* much higher. Big upward move without much consolidation...

**Trade Plan:** Ideally failed 102 push and then lower highs. Will only trade this on pullback with set risk and lower highs.

**Levels of Interest**:

* Resistance: $102

GRUB (Previous Close: <mark>30.77</mark> | ATR: <mark>1.18</mark>)
---
**Bias**: Short

**Why**: Short biased on this one. Getting into overbought territory. Last two days green, but closed at bottom of range 

**Trade Plan:** Ideally <mark>31 push and fail</mark>, then confirmation. If push and fail will short with risk at this level. 

**Levels of Interest**:

* Resistance: $31
* Support: $29

LL (Previous Close: <mark>15.88</mark> | ATR: <mark>0.75</mark>)
---
**Bias**: Short

**Why**: Looks overbought and has failed 16 numerous times. May breakthrough, but I expect a little pullback first

**Trade Plan:** Ideally <mark>16 push and fail</mark>, then confirmation of downard trend.  

**Levels of Interest**:

* Resistance: $16

PAYX (Previous Close: <mark>15.88</mark> | ATR: <mark>0.75</mark>)

* Resistance: $60
