BURL (Previous Close: <mark>66.88</mark> | ATR: <mark>1.61</mark>)

{% comment %}
ME: Overbought
{% endcomment %}
**Bias**: Short

**Why**: Previously had this as a long. Looks a bit overextended and may need to consolidate a little.

**Trade Plan:** Ideally multiple failing tests of 68 level followed by lower highs. If opens weak, wait for pullback and risk on yesterday's close.

**Levels of Interest**:

* Support: $64
* Resistance: $68, $67

MBLY (Previous Close: <mark>45.03</mark> | ATR: <mark>2.03</mark>)

{% comment %}
ME: Overbought
{% endcomment %}
**Bias**: Short

**Why**: Looks overbought. Red day today. Looking for another red day and ideally some of the gap to be filled.

**Trade Plan:** Need to see it fail 45 and show downward progress. ATR is wide given stock price, so need to be careful with entry.

**Levels of Interest**:

* Support: $64
* Resistance: $68, $67

CCI (Previous Close: <mark>102.56</mark> | ATR: <mark>1.34</mark>)
---
{% comment %}
ME: Overbought
{% endcomment %}
**Bias**: Short

**Why**: Keeping this on scan for now but may not be in play for a few more days. Still think it needs to pull back before going *too* much higher. Big upward move without much consolidation...

**Trade Plan:** At this point, waiting for failed 105 push and then lower highs. Will only trade this on pullback with set risk and lower highs.

**Levels of Interest**:

* Resistance: $105

PAYX (Previous Close: <mark>15.88</mark> | ATR: <mark>0.75</mark>)
---
{% comment %}
ME: Overbought
{% endcomment %}
**Bias**: Short
**Bias**: Short

**Why**: Keeping on scan for time being. Huge upward movement without consolidation. Closed just above 60 today. Potential for pullback if it cannot hold this level.

**Trade Plan:** Fails to hold 60, then confirmation of downard trend. Otherwise, don't touch this.

**Levels of Interest**:

* Resistance: $60

NVDA (Previous Close: <mark>47.35</mark> | ATR: <mark>1.13</mark>)

{% comment %}
ME: Long Term Breakout
{% endcomment %}
**Bias**: Long

**Why**: Nice upward move in May followed by consolidation in June.  Upward progress today. Might not be an immediate play, but if it can break and hold 48, I like this for a move towards 50.

**Trade Plan:** Breaks and confirms 48, shows higher lows.

**Levels of Interest**:

* Resistance: $47.75
* Support: 46.15

TWLO (Previous Close: <mark>34.04</mark> | ATR: <mark>4.64</mark>)
---

**Bias**: Long

**Why**: Big pullback in last 3 days of trading. If support (from 06/29) at 32 can hold, could be nice upward move. 

**Trade Plan:** Ideally opens weak, tests and confirms 32, then shows higher lows. Big ATR on this one, be very careful

**Levels of Interest**:

* Resistance: 40
* Support: 32
