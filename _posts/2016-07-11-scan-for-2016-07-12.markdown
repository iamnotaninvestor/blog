{% comment %}
ME: Potential Breakout
{% endcomment %}
**Bias**: Long

**Why**: At a key level right now, with increasing volume over the last couple of days. Looks to have a solid foundation at 42s

**Trade Plan:** Ideally I'd like to see a test and confirmation of 45 prior to entry. 

**Levels of Interest**:

* Resistance: $45.20

SHAK (Previous Close: <mark>37.49</mark> | ATR: <mark>1.41</mark>)

{% comment %}
ME: Potential Breakout
{% endcomment %}
**Bias**: Long

**Why**: Also at a key level right now. Decent upward move today. If this breaks through 38.50 could attempt to fill March gap.

**Trade Plan:** Want to see resistance at 37.20s become support for push towards 38.50. Ideally pullback to 37.20s and higher lows for entry

**Levels of Interest**:

* Support: $37.20
* Resistance: $38, $38.50

ATVI (Previous Close: <mark>42.20</mark> | ATR: <mark>1.04</mark>)
---
{% comment %}
ME: Overbought
{% endcomment %}
**Bias**: Short

**Why**: This is going straight up. Want this on scan on correction day

**Trade Plan:** Don't try to guess top here. Wait for lower highs to confirm and risk of previous high. Need tight stop.

CCI (Previous Close: <mark>100.54</mark> | ATR: <mark>1.42</mark>)
---
{% comment %}
ME: Overbought
{% endcomment %}
**Bias**: Short

**Why**: Really tired of this one but want on radar in case there is a big pullback.

**Trade Plan:** Waiting for this to break below 100, re-test and fail. Will only trade this on pullback with set risk and lower highs.

**Levels of Interest**:

* Resistance: $100
