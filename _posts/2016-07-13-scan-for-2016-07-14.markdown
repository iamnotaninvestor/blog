ME: Potential Breakout

**Bias**: Long

**Why**: Keeping this on scan from yesterday. I still like how this chart looks. Steady upward progress and took out long term resistance today. may attempt gap fill in short term. 

**Trade Plan:** Want to see 35.50 (or 35, depending on open) holding and putting in higher lows. Looking for a push above 36 and ideally a big candle attempting gap fill to 37.

**Levels of Interest**:

* Support: $35.50, $35
* Resistance: $37

ME: Potential Breakout
{% endcomment %}
**Bias**: Long

**Why**: Potential 200 SMA breakout on the cards as well as big magnet at 70. 

**Trade Plan:** This has had about 10 green days in a row, so may need some consolidation before making push through 70 and 200 SMA. Ideally weak open for accumulation with confirmation of 69 (or even 69.50 levels) for entry.

**Levels of Interest**:

* Support: $67.50
* Resistance: $70, $70.40, $71.60

**Bias**: Short

**Levels of Interest**:

* Resistance: $40
