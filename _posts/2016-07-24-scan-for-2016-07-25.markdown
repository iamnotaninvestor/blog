**Bias**: <mark class="short">Short</mark>

**Why**: Down 8% Friday on poor earnings. Closed below SMA 50 after dip below SMA 20 but closed mid-range. Potential for more downward follow-through.

**Trade Plan:** Want to see 65 level failing and acting as resistance with big volume. Has potential to drop $2-3.

**Levels of Interest**:

* Resistance: 65

**Bias**: <mark class="long">Long</mark>

**Why**: Solid support at 50.75. Upward movement last few days and bottoming tail on Friday. Next resistance at ~53s then a lot of room for upward move.

**Trade Plan:** 

Test and hold 52 then put in higher lows. Typically trades fairly closely with SPY, so weak market might foil plan.

**Levels of Interest**:

Support: 52
Resistance: 53 (whole $), 53.25, 53.75
