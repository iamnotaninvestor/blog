**Bias**: <mark class="long">Long</mark>

**Why**: This might be on scan for a few more days. I think this can still go higher. Held 26 today, could have a big green day soon. 

**Trade Plan:** 

Looking for confirmation that 26 level is solid and higher lows. Risk off 26. Don't enter if this drops below 26.

**Levels of Interest**:

Support: 26

**Bias**: <mark class="short">Short</mark>

**Why**: Four red days in and finished below SMA 50 today. Interested in what happens next, but think there may be a short trade her soon. 

**Trade Plan:** Either push towards 70 and fail or increased selling under SMA 50. Looking for lower highs, high volume on red candles and pullback for entry.

**Levels of Interest**:

* Resistance: 70

**Bias**: <mark class="short">Short</mark>

**Why**: Fighting SMA 20. Green day on Monday erased by red day today. If breaks through 70 could have big red candle. 

**Trade Plan:** 70 is key level. Look for 70 fail and lower highs with set risk of 70. Don't trade above 70.

**Levels of Interest**:

* Support: 70
