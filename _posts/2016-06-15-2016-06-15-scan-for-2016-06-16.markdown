Overview
--- 
I'm trying to find a structure for my scans. The 'Why' seems important, as do levels of interest and potential theses. This will be refined as I go.

**Disclaimer:** I am not a broker or dealer. I am not qualified nor do I wish to offer investment or financial advice. I am publishing these trades for my own educational purposes. My theses may be incorrect and trading these tickers may result in financial loss/ruin. All trades undertaken are done so at your own risk.

**Bias**: Short

**Why**: While potentially oversold, has closed at lows with increasing volume last 3 days. Expect another day or two of downward pressure before reversal. The last bearish pattern lasting 6 days or more was in October 2015 and lasted 8 days. Similar setup this time around.

**Levels of Interest**:

* Resistance: $31, $31.20
* Support: ~$30.28

**Thesis 1**: Strong Open
- If breaks above $31 watch today's $31.20 level. This was tested 3 times but not broken. Expect resistance here. I'll wait for a move back below $31 before trading this name.

**Thesis 2**: Weak Open
- Ideally tests $31 and fails, then lower highs. Risk off of $31 with ideal entry in .80s or .90s
