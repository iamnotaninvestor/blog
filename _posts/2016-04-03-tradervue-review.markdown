Introduction

[Tradervue](http://www.tradervue.com/?friendref=9003/) advertises itself as the "trading journal that will help improve your trading performance". To me, the disciplined execution of a well-reasoned plan is much more rewarding than a lucky windfall. As such, keeping a trading journal is vital and it's important to have a good system in place. You may have noticed that I have a [Tradervue](http://www.tradervue.com/?friendref=9003/) affiliate link at the bottom of this site. I'm obviously a fan so let me walk you through what I like, and what I think could be improved. **Note:** There are three pricing tiers available: Free, Silver and Gold. This review is based on my experiences as a paying Gold tier subscriber. 


The Good
---
You'll be forgiven if you feel underwhelmed upon logging into Tradervue for the first time. There is nothing flashy about the site nor is it particularly sexy. The color scheme is flat, perhaps even a little dated, and the screens feel somewhat sparse, especially on a high resolution display. Don't let its looks fool you. I've developed software professionally for many years and have learned not to be impressed by flashy graphics or stock images. In software development, as in life, style is easy. Substance is much more difficult. Tradervue prioritizes substance over style. 

First thing's first. Tradervue is a very capable trading journal. Journaling is straightforward and the site has all of the mechanics you'd expect, exactly where you'd expect to find them. Notes can be added both to individual trades and also to the trading day itself. The note editor supports the use of rich text (as expected) and the insertion of images and even youtube videos - the latter making it easy to retain scans and video plans with journal entries. Custom tags can be used to categorize trades. It's all very simple.

There's a note on the trade entry page that reads: **"Note! This form creates a trade to be matched later with execution data imported from your broker"**. This is where things start to get interesting. Tradervue offers two mechanisms to take the heavy lifting out of journaling. 1) The site integrates with various brokers allowing trade executions to be imported instead of entered manually. This reduces tedium and increases accuracy. What started out as a luxury is something I would now find difficult to live without. 2) The system allows trades to be entered without needing to wait around for them to complete. What does this mean and why is it important? Well, imagine you're trading AAPL and have bought 1000 shares. You can immediately start journaling and document your thoughts throughout the day, despite the fact that you have not yet sold those shares and have not imported any data for that trade from your broker. Later, when you import your trading data, your trade executions will automatically be reconciled with your journal entry. All of your data will be in the right place, without any manual effort required on your part. This might sound small, but the ability to journal in real-time, versus trying to summarize your thought process after the fact, is extremely beneficial. There's a lot of value here.

Tradervue's true value lies in its myriad of reports and metrics. Once you have some trading data in the system, it's time to dig into the site's seemingly interminable charts, graphs and data tables. There are far too many for me to adequately cover in this post, so I'll share a few of my favorites. The *Trades View* screen displays trades in tabular form, and columns can be configured as desired (my only frustration is the seemingly arbitrary restriction allowing only 12 columns). Though simple, I used this screen constantly to get an eagle-eye view of my trades. I configured the screen to show not only my (net) P&L, but also the Best Exit and Exit Efficiency. In the screenshot below, I've highlighed how, what look like decent trades (given my small position), could have been significantly better. This kind of insight - seeing that I was leaving a lot of money on the table - prompted me to reevaluate how I was trading winners.

I also found myself revisiting the *Detailed Report*, often. This report is a trove of useful statistics and charts (the latter not visible in the screenshot below). Something you'll probably notice in the below screenshot, that is common across Tradervue, is the ability to filter and configure the data to find exactly what you're looking for. As a trader of small positions, avoiding commission grinding is extremely important to me - so I appreciate the ability to easily switch between Net and Gross figures. I also frequently filtered based on trade side (long or short) and tags I used when reviewing my trades, making it easy to quantify the cost of chases, early exits and other bad habits that I previously identified.

Before Tradervue I used a spreadsheet to track trading performance. It took a lot of manual effort to update and moreso to derive any real insight related to my trading performance. Tradervue provides numerous options to break down trading performance based on the instrument being traded, market factors (what was SPY/USO/etc. doing), time of day, price and volume and more. This information is very actionable. Here I learned that I lost the most money trading during the lull (read: boredom trading), I should stay away from certain tickers and how I trade when SPY is up or down.

Presented above are some of my favorite reports available in Tradervue. It's important to note that this review has barely scratched the surface of what is available - there are many other charts and reports that I haven't mentioned. In the interest of brevity I've highlighted only those that I used most frequently.  

The Bad
---
[Tradervue](http://www.tradervue.com/?friendref=9003/) works well and provides a lot of value. I ran into few issues using the software religiously for 3 months. When I did reach out to the support team, I received answers to my questions very quickly. I'm a big fan and there is nothing that would stop me from recommending this software. That said, there is always room for improvement.

Let's talk about pricing. For the record, I don't think Tradervue is expensive. In fact, for those already profitably trading, the Gold tier is a no brainer. It is an excellent journaling tool that provides plenty of actionable insight into trading performance. One such insight could potentially cover the cost of the software for a long time. Unfortunately I wasn't consistently profitable when signing up. My perspective was that of a beginner day trader. The free tier didn't provide much value to me, due to its limited reporting and trade restrictions (100 trades per month at time of writing). The silver tier, at $29 per month was reasonably priced but hamstrung by the lack of exit analysis, risk analysis and commissions and fees - all things that I considered vital for my style of trading. So, the choice was to invest $29 per month in a package that didn't give me everything I needed or pay a ~40% markup for the $49 per month Gold tier. As much as I love Tradervue it is non-essential compared to the many other fees/costs associated with day trading. I'm not complaining - Tradervue are entitled to charge whatever they feel appropriate for their service. However, pricing is something that caused me pause hence its inclusion in this review.

Next up, the missing killer feature. Tradervue captures an immense amount of data and provides many metrics, but it could leverage more number crunching and advanced analytics to provide even more intelligent insight to end users. The biggest frustration for me is that the site didn't leverage the data it gathers to provide trading insight using natural language. I wish that upon logging into  the system, Tradervue would slap me in the face with suggestions like **"We noticed that 68% of time that you trade the oil sector you lose money"** or **"You chase trades in the morning. On average this week, waiting an extra 5 minutes for entry would have resulted in 10% more profit"**. Most of the data appears to be in the system already, additional data could be derived from tick-by-tick chart data, and the development team appears to have the technical chops to carry something like this off. I only wonder if, for legal reasons, they simply cannot provide such feedback lest it be considered investment advice. I suspect that this is not the case; as I said earlier much of the data is already present, but in a different form.

I encountered two minor annoyances related to the importing of trading data from my broker. Firstly, DAS Trader doesn't 
currently allow 3rd parties to import its data during the day. So, I had to wait until midnight to actually see my charts and trading data. This is a DAS issue, not a Tradervue issue, and if enough people request earlier access to their data, perhaps it will happen. A workaround exists - the user can export the data to CSV from DAS and then import the CSV in Tradervue - but this completely diminishes the value of this mechanism. Secondly, there is no mechanism allowing data to be auto imported when available in the broker's system. The ability to schedule Tradervue to pull data from DAS on a nightly basis would have been a step in the right direction, if imperfect, but unfortunately this is not possible in its current incarnation.

Finally, the lack of a mobile app is a somewhat glaring ommission. The ability to view past trades and ticker summaries while on the go, but mobile apps are not yet available on any platform. As this is a premium service, such features are expected.

In Closing
---
[Tradervue](http://www.tradervue.com/?friendref=9003/) is a fantastic tool, both in terms of how easy it is to log trades and also the many insights it provides into trading performance. The team adds new features frequently and I'm always excited to see what is coming next. My bottom line for day traders is simple - if you can afford the Gold tier, then this software is great and will likely cast some light on trading deficiencies you were not aware of.
