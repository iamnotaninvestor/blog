**Bias**: <mark class="short">Short</mark>

**Why**: Same plan as today. Near top of downward trend and failed to break through SMA 50. Think this has a few red days coming. 

**Trade Plan:** Ideally drop through 73 and failed retests. If it moves upwards, very interested in 74 mark as this marks the top of a downward trend that started in April; might be some resistance here.

**Levels of Interest**:

* Resistance: 74, 73

**Bias**: <mark class="short">Short</mark>

**Why** Like how the chart looks. Nice downward move from 65. Broke below SMA 20 and 50. Topping candle and whole number break today. 

**Trade Plan:** Ideally tests 62 a few times and fails. Nice to have a whole number to risk off. Could have a couple of dollar downward move in it soon.

**Levels of Interest**:
Support: 62

Support: 74, 73
