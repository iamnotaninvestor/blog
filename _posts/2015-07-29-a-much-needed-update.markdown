In the weeks following my initial blog posts I learnt some valuable lessons about day trading...and decided to take a step back. I won't regale you with all of the details but suffice it to say I broke every rule I made, discarded every lesson I learnt and lost a significant portion of my trading allowance in the process. Over the past 12 months I've dedicated as much time as possible to identfying what I did wrong, and learning to become a better trader. I'd like to get back trading soon, but I'm still not ready. There are things I don't know that I still need to learn. In the coming weeks I'll explain where I went wrong, what I learnt and how I improved.
