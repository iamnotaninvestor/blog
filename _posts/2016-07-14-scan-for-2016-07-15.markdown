{% comment %}
ME: Overbought
{% endcomment %}
**Bias**: <mark class="short">Short</mark>

**Why**: Had this on scan a couple of times in the past week. Want this on scan on correction day. 

**Trade Plan:** Trades closely with SPY, so market will dicatate a lot. Ideally failed push towards 42 and lower highs. If pushes above 42, monitor whole/half dollar marks and failed follow through for entry.  
**Levels of Interest**:

* Support: $39.50

CCI (Previous Close: <mark>99.47</mark> | ATR: <mark>1.41</mark>)
---
{% comment %}
ME: Overbought
{% endcomment %}
**Bias**: <mark class="short">Short</mark>

**Why**: Steady downward trend over past week. Think this might have a big red day at some point soon.

**Trade Plan:** Ideally strong open, 100 test and fail, higher lows. If weak open, wait for pullback before entry.

**Levels of Interest**:

* Resistance: $100

JWN (Previous Close: <mark>40.87</mark> | ATR: <mark>1.16</mark>)
---
{% comment %}
ME: Overbought
{% endcomment %}
**Bias**: <mark class="short">Short</mark>

**Why**: Looks like topping action with resistance on 42

**Trade Plan:** Trades closely with SPY, so market will dicatate a lot. Ideally push on open, 41 test and fail, lower highs. Today's close (40.87) may be sitting on short term support, so want to see it fail this level before trading.

**Levels of Interest**:

* Resistance: $42
* Support: 40.87

FEYE (Previous Close: <mark>16.55</mark> | ATR: <mark>0.77</mark>)
---
**Bias**: <mark class="long">Long</mark>

**Why**: Am interested in a potential breakout if it can retake 17 level.

**Trade Plan:** Needs to hold 16.50s, confirm this level, and show higher lows. 

**Levels of Interest**:

* Support: 16.50s
* Resistance 17.20

***

CRUS (Previous Close: <mark>40.47</mark> | ATR: <mark>1.44</mark>)
---
**Bias**: <mark class="long">Long</mark>

**Why**: Long term upward channel. Recovering well after gap down and can potentially take out long term high at 41.08

**Trade Plan:** Ideally weak open and confirmation of 40. Risk off 40 for accumulation for move towards 41. 

**Levels of Interest**:

* Resistance 41.08
