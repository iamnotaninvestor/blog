      <h3>Always Get a Deal from your Online Broker</h3>

<p>Every single online broker I've seen offers free trades for new accounts. I signed up for my current broker in a rush and missed out on a bunch of free trades. Don't let that happen to you. It's the easiest thing in the world to search online for a coupon. If you can't find one, contact the broker. They want your money more than you want to use their specific service.</p>

<h3>Don't Underestimate Transaction Fees</h3>

<p>It may be tempting to underestimate the cost of a stock transaction when choosing a broker. Sure, Scottrade is $2 cheaper than, say, E-Trade, but it's <em>only</em> $2. Right? Starting out that $2, which is really $4 when you're talking about buying and selling the security (2 transactions), makes a difference. Now, imagine optionshouse which is $2 per transaction cheaper again and you can see the savings adding up. It shouldn't be the deciding factor in choosing your broker but it should be taken into account - especially if you are making many small trades.</p>

<h3>Simulator or the Real Thing?</h3>

<p>Before I got started I decided to play along with the market using paper trading. That way I could jump in without risking any real money. It was a fun experience - myself and some buddies used investopedia's simulator to compete against each other - but in the end it's just not the real thing. I found myself checking my account once every day or two and was nowhere near as attentive as I am when real money is invovled. It's a little like playing poker with no money at stake - everyone pays to see the flop. Don't get me wrong, there is definitely value in paper trading but if you can handle the risk you'll likely learn more investing a small amount of money in the real world.</p>

<h3>Fund Settlement</h3>

<p>When you trade it may take some time for your funds to settle. Typically in the US it takes 3 days. Any purchases made with unsettled funds are essentially being made with borrowed money meaning that if you sell before the funds settle, your trade is classified by the SEC as a free ride. The easy solution, assuming you can be self-disciplined and not touch the money, is to buffer your account with enough cash to cover trades while funds settle. Alternatively, if you qualify for a margin account your broker may cover you during the settlement period.</p>

<h3>Use Limit Orders</h3>

<p>99% of the time you're going to want to use a limit order (i.e. setting the price you are willing to buy or sell a security at) rather than a market order. Pulling the trigger on a market order can lead to higher buy and lower sell prices. <em>Always</em> use limit orders until you have a specific reason not to.</p>

<h3>Tolerable Losses</h3>

<p>DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING WITHOUT AN ESCAPE PLAN. If you don't have a specific number to sell at to cut your losses then just don't trade. Smart losses are as important as smart gains.</p>

<h3>Know Your Limits</h3>

<p>Many popular traders that you'll see on social networks invest significant capital on every trade, needing only a small margin gain for good returns. In cases where they do not share their exit plan in advance, it's easy to assume that the stock prices are set to skyrocket. Afterall, why would these guys who know so much be putting their money into this ticker? Remember that you do not have the same capital to invest. While a seasoned investor might sell a stock with a 10c gain per share, you might be stuck waiting for a 50c or $1 gain that is never coming. Follow these guys for fun and for educational purposes (it is <em>amazing</em> to see some of the big gains and losses) but remember, they are in a different league right now and play by different rules.</p>
